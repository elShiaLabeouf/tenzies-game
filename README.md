# Tenzies

This is a game called Tenzies. Each player gets ten six-sided dice. Each player rolls their dice. Each player picks a number they want to collect (e.g., all 3s). Players keep the dice that match their chosen number by clicking on it and quickly re-roll the rest.

Keep rolling and setting aside matching dice until all ten dice show the same number.
